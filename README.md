## Steps to generate AudioReach documentation

1) Clone audioreach-doc repository.
	```
	git clone https://github.com/Audioreach/audioreach-doc.git
	```

2) Fetch API header files from AudioReach repositories to generate document:
	```
	cd <audioreach-doc root dir>
	make sync_api_files
	```
	This generates ./api_files directory with API files fetched to respective component sub-directories.

3) Run Doxygen using configuration file [Doxyfile.in](./source/Doxyfile.in) to
generate the XML files:
	```
	cd sources
	doxygen ./Doxyfile.in
	```
	This generates ./doxygen/xml/ directory which contains the output XML's generated by doxygen.

4) To generate Sphinx output with configuration file [conf.py](./source/conf.py),
run below command from audioreach-doc root directory:
	```
	make html
	```
	This command generates Sphinx output at audioreach-doc/build/html
	directory. To delete Sphinx output file and start over use `make clean`
	command.

5) Open index.html or drag it to browser, to view generated AudioReach document.
